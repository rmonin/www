# Looking for a bookmark manager

**TL;DR** [Raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io) ðŸ¤ž

## Context / Overview

I used to rely on [Xmarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xmarks_Sync) in the past to synchronize my bookmarks across different operating systems and browsers. Over time, my bookmark collection had become gargantuan and lost its coherence. Consequently, I decided to stop adding anything to my bookmarks, reasoning that if a resource is useful, it should be retrievable.

In practice, this "non-method" does work for the majority of my needs. However, for the rare occasions when I need to find an obscure, poorly referenced site discussing a very specific topic, it falls short.

Therefore, I've decided to give it another try, and I'm going to test out [Raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io) but i already know it will not be my final choice.

[Wallabag](https://wallabag.org/) is truly remarkable, and I highly recommend it (even the [paid subscription](https://www.wallabag.it/en) pricing is consistently good ðŸ¥°). And won't supplant this app for my reading list and RSS management!

## Key features

- **Free**
- **2FA login**
- **Cross-Platform Syncing**
- **Advanced Tagging**
- **Rich Content Support** web pages, articles, images, videos, and documents.
- **Bookmarklet**: plugin integrated to web browsers, allowing to save bookmarks with a single click.
- **Collaboration Features**
- **Backup** (only manually on free version) on html and csv formats (i.e simple and **open** format !)

## Drawbacks

I did not find how to manage mail subscription except on Welcome email message... And it seems to spam easily for each minor action such as

- Export file created
- Bookmark imported

There are some missing features too

- No builtin sync... https://better.raindrop.io/feature-requests/p/full-sync-with-chrome-and-safari
- Bakcup is not automatic and process may takes some delay sometimes...
- no auto tagging
