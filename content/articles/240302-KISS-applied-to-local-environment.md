# KISS applied to your local environment

[KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) is a principle I keep in mind whenever I have to install, configure, or use software, or choose a technology.

## Selection Criteria

I have a few criteria that are not mantras but guidelines. I try to align with these ideas to stay close to my vision and maintain, I believe, a comfortable working environment. I do not claim to have an objective view, and I can make entirely subjective choices without any shame 😁

### Open Source

Given the choice between open-source and proprietary software, I prefer the former. This is not only due to ideology but also because most often there is an active community driving its development and maintenance, which reassures me because even if the project is dead, it is still usable.

### Open Format

I prefer the file format to be accessible and in an open format. This allows me to...

### Large and Open Community

When seeking help...

### Longevity of Product

To avoid switching tools every other day.

> **Note:** Longevity does not necessarily mean outdated. There are very good software packages that, due to their simplicity, remain timeless or are updated to incorporate new practices over time.

I also do not refrain from testing new software that brings real added value.

### Available on RHEL

If it's available on RHEL, I assume they've done all the research work upfront for stability, popularity, simplicity, and security. Even if I disagree with their choice, I still try to prioritize this solution because if it's from them, there's a good chance it's the default on a server, across all distributions. As I don't want to bother learning two software packages - one that I like and can use at home or on servers where I have operational freedom, and one that is installed everywhere by default.

## How to Find?

Out of habit, I search on:

- **Arch Wiki** [url](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/List_of_applications) a very comprehensive and well-categorized list.
- **Debian packages** a large collection of stable and maintained packages. Since Debian is the base of many distributions, it gives me a mini guarantee that the software is available everywhere.
- **RHEL** a quick check for peace of mind if it's a command-line tool potentially usable on a server.
- **LibHunt** [url](https://www.libhunt.com) to keep myself informed about the latest developments.
