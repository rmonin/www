### Syllabe Criteria

The term _syllables_ refers to the units of sound in the Chinese language that are transcribed using the pinyin system of Romanization. Pinyin is a widely used system for representing the sounds of Mandarin Chinese using the Roman alphabet, and it is an important tool for teaching and learning the Chinese language.

In the HSK, students are assessed on their ability to recognize and produce the correct pinyin representations of Chinese syllables, which are essential for effective communication in Chinese. This includes their ability to produce the correct tone, pronunciation, and rhythm of each syllable, which are all important factors in effective communication in the language.

### Character Criteria

_Characters_ refers to the written symbols used to represent words in the Chinese language. In the HSK, students are assessed on their ability to recognize, read, write, and use a certain number of characters, which are a fundamental component of the Chinese writing system.

The number of characters that students need to know for handwriting in the HSK depends on the level of the test. Each level of the HSK covers a different set of characters, with more advanced levels requiring knowledge of a larger number of characters. For example, HSK Level 1 tests students on 300 characters, while HSK Level 6 tests students on around 1,800 characters.

### Vocabulary Criteria

_Vocabulary_ refers to the words used in the Chinese language. Vocabulary includes both single characters and composed characters that form words.

Each level of the HSK covers a different set of vocabulary items. The vocabulary items tested in the HSK are selected based on their frequency of use in real-world situations, as well as their usefulness and relevance to a wide range of topics and situations.

### Grammar Criteria

_Grammar_ refers to the set of rules that govern the way words and phrases are put together to form meaningful sentences in the Chinese language. Students are assessed on their ability to use grammar structures accurately and appropriately, which is essential for effective communication in the language.
