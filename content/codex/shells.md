# Shells

## Bourne shell

The [Bourne shell](/codex/bourne-shell) is the traditional Unix shell originally written by Stephen Bourne.

## Bash

[Bash](/codex/gnu-bash) is the shell, or command language interpreter, for the gnu operating system. The name is an acronym for the ‘Bourne-Again SHell’, a pun on Stephen Bourne, the author of the direct ancestor of the current Unix shell sh, which appeared in the Seventh Edition Bell Labs Research version of Unix.
