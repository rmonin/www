#### Syllabe Criteria

The term _syllables_ refers to the units of sound in the Chinese language that are transcribed using the pinyin system of Romanization. Pinyin is a widely used system for representing the sounds of Mandarin Chinese using the Roman alphabet, and it is an important tool for teaching and learning the Chinese language.

In the HSK, students are assessed on their ability to recognize and produce the correct pinyin representations of Chinese syllables, which are essential for effective communication in Chinese. This includes their ability to produce the correct tone, pronunciation, and rhythm of each syllable, which are all important factors in effective communication in the language.

#### Character Criteria

_Characters_ refers to the written symbols used to represent words in the Chinese language. In the HSK, students are assessed on their ability to recognize, read, write, and use a certain number of characters, which are a fundamental component of the Chinese writing system.

The number of characters that students need to know for handwriting in the HSK depends on the level of the test. Each level of the HSK covers a different set of characters, with more advanced levels requiring knowledge of a larger number of characters. For example, HSK Level 1 tests students on 300 characters, while HSK Level 6 tests students on around 1,800 characters.

#### Vocabulary Criteria

_Vocabulary_ refers to the words used in the Chinese language. Vocabulary includes both single characters and composed characters that form words.

Each level of the HSK covers a different set of vocabulary items. The vocabulary items tested in the HSK are selected based on their frequency of use in real-world situations, as well as their usefulness and relevance to a wide range of topics and situations.

#### Grammar Criteria

_Grammar_ refers to the set of rules that govern the way words and phrases are put together to form meaningful sentences in the Chinese language. Students are assessed on their ability to use grammar structures accurately and appropriately, which is essential for effective communication in the language.

## Five major styles of Chinese calligraphy

### 1.Seal Script (篆書, zhuànshū)

![seal-script](/files/chinese/seal-script.png)

**From** Zhou Dynasty (周朝）

Adopted as the final script for all of China during the Qin dynasty. It was widely used for decorating and engraving purposes during the Han Dynasty. It belongs to the Bronze Age of China and in logographic in nature. It still comprises of historical, cultural and artistic values and significance. Efforts are being invested to encode it in Unicode through computer coding in order to ensure its survival.

### 2.Clerical Script (隸書, lìshū)

![clerical-script](/files/chinese/clerical-script.png)

> **From** Qin Dynasty (秦朝）

The clerical script is an archaic style of Chinese calligraphy which evolved from the Warring States period to the Qin dynasty, was a dominant script in the Han dynasty, and remained in use through the Wei-Jin periods.

Due to its high legibility to modern readers, it is still used for artistic flavour in a variety of functional applications such as headlines, signboards, and advertisements. This legibility stems from the highly rectilinear structure, a feature shared with modern regular script. In structure and rectilinearity, it is generally similar to the modern script; however, in contrast with the tall to square modern script, it tends to be square to wide, and often has a pronounced, wavelike flaring of isolated major strokes, especially a dominant rightward or downward diagonal stroke.

### 3.Regular script (楷書, kǎishū)

![regular-script](/files/chinese/regular-script.png)

> **From** Eastern Han Dynasty (東漢）_151-230 CE_

Regular script is also known as “uniform script” and “real script”, referring to a typeface of order. Regular script is a regular typeface directly evolved from clerical script. It turned the “silkworm head and wild goose tail” of clerical script into a flat and straight form. The word turns from being flat to square and regular.

This script has remained in use until now and is the fundamental skill people must learn well in their study of calligraphy.

### 4.Cursive Script (草書, cǎoshū)

![cursive-script](/files/chinese/cursive-script.png)

> **From** Eastern Han Dynasty (東漢）

Faster to write than other styles, but difficult to read for those unfamiliar with it. It functions primarily as a kind of shorthand script or calligraphic style. People who can read standard or printed forms of Chinese may not be able to comprehend this script.

### 5.Running Script (行書, xíngshū)

![running-script](/files/chinese/running-script.png)

> **From** Eastern Han Dynasty (東漢）

A cursive style of Chinese characters. Because it is not as abbreviated as cursive, most people who can read regular script can read running script. It is highly useful and also artistic.

Running script had already been formed in the late Eastern Han Dynasty and reached its prime in the early Jin Dynasty. Its style moderates between regular script and cursive script: it is more free-flowing than the orderly regular script while more easily recognized than the spontaneous cursive script. It was thus widely used. Although running script runs in unrestrained manner, excelling in the writing of this script was not easy. Good practice of regular script is a pre-requisite for fine writing in running script. It comprises of the use of portly brushes and the dots and lines are bulging, comparable to iron wrapped in cotton; the use of ink is strong; the centre of the combination of the structure is closely knit while the upper right angle is relaxing.
